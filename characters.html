          <h3 class="mt-0">Finn the Human</h3>
          <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finn debuted at age 12 but aged over the course of the show, and was 17 by the series finale. Finn sets off on magical random quests around the Land of Ooo. He would gladly fight or beat up anything evil, but would not harm anything good or "neutral" as shown in "The Enchiridion!" when he refused to squash an innocent ant. Having a strong moral code, Finn swore that he would help anyone in need and often performs heroic feats to save the day; however,[2] Finn's enthusiastic nature becomes more toned down as the series progresses, suggesting he is both maturing and developing as a character as he ages. As shown in "Memories of Boom Boom Mountain", Finn appears to have been abandoned in the woods during infancy. He reveals that he had made "boom boom"—a euphemism for defecation—on a large leaf, fallen on it, and lay there crying until Joshua and Margaret, Jake's parents, rescued him from the wilderness and took him in to raise him alongside Jake, who became like a brother to him. As such, Jake is also Finn's adoptive brother. In "Henchman", when Finn is asked about his parents, he says Jake told him that he came from a cabbage, in jest. In the episode "Susan Strong", Finn states that he knows nothing of his human parents or any other humans. He is one of the few characters in the series (along with Flame Princess) who ages regularly. According to the episode "The Vault", Finn has had a number of past lives. In "Red Starved" it is revealed that Finn is color blind, believing that an emerald was a ruby.</p>
          <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Season 6 opener "Escape From the Citadel", Finn has lost half of his right arm, up to his elbow, from which a flower protruded. He later regains his arm, now as a prosthetic, in the episode "Breezy", only to lose it once more in the episode "Reboot" when his grass arm transforms itself into a humanoid, sentient being. In the following episode "Two Swords", Finn gets fitted with a new robotic arm by Princess Bubblegum, to replace the missing arm. In the Season 9 finale "Three Buckets" it is revealed that this arm can transform into many different weapons.
          Finn's ultimate fate is not revealed; however, the series finale "Come Along With Me" heavily implies that the cat-like creature named Shermy—who finds Finn's discarded prosthetic arm a thousand years in the future—is Finn's latest reincarnation.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-0">Jake the Dog</h3>
        <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jake is Finn's best friend and adoptive brother. He is a shape-shifting dog who is in his 30s in "magical dog years". He was conceived by Joshua and Margaret. As a puppy Jake rolled around in a puddle of magic mud, giving him magical abilities. Jake can stretch, shrink, or mold any part of his body to any shape and almost any size, ranging from becoming gigantic to becoming incredibly small. He acts as a confident mentor to his energetic brother, though has a tendency to give somewhat questionable advice. Jake has a laid-back attitude in most situations, but loves adventure and will eagerly fight when he needs to. His powers help Finn considerably in combat and transportation, but are also sometimes used as nothing more than jovial forms of expression. Jake is in a relationship with Lady Rainicorn voiced by Niki Yang; they have five children together as seen in "Jake the Dad". He met Lady in the pilot episode and is quite skilled at playing the viola, which houses a worm called Shelby.</p>
        <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jake was conceived when his father, Joshua, was bitten by the shapeshifter, an extra-dimensional creature named Warren Ampersand, during a detective investigation with his wife Margaret, and was later born from a pustule on his father's head originating from the creature's bite. It is inferred that Jake's natural magical powers are a result of his biological relationship with Ampersand,[1] though he himself is apparently unaware of the circumstances of his birth and instead believes his powers to be the result of having rolled around in a "magical mud puddle" as a pup. After his birth, Jake was raised normally by Joshua and Margaret as their son, alongside their own biological son Jermaine and their adoptive human son Finn.
        Little has been shown in the series thus far about Jake's subsequent childhood life with his family, though in his youth, he was known to be a successful criminal and the leader of his own gang, a position he later retired from to take part in a more respectable life as an adventurer with Finn.[4] Around this time, he also began a romantic relationship with Lady Rainicorn, with whom he has five children—daughters Charlie, Viola, and Jake Jr., and sons T.V. and Kim Kil Whan.</p>

              <h3 class="mt-0">Marceline the Vampire Queen</h3>
              <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roughly a thousand years prior to the events of the series, Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson) and a human woman (voiced by Rebecca Sugar). Abadeer is the ruler of the Nightosphere—a Hellish dimension sustained by "chaotic evil"—and subsists on the souls of sentient beings.For some reason, Marceline was left abandoned on Earth in events during the Mushroom War, a mysterious war that ravaged the earth one thousand years prior to events of the series. During this time, Simon Petrikov—the name of the Ice King before he was overcome by the evil power of his crown—found Marceline in the ruins of a city and gave her a stuffed animal named Hambo to cheer her up.The two developed a caring relationship, although the crown took a toll on Simon's mental health, forcing him to leave Marceline alone.During this period in her life, she was reunited with her father,only to be disgusted by his cold and heartless ways. Although she attempted to tolerate his evil and selfish antics, she eventually severed all ties with Abadeer after she discovered him eating fries that she had made for herself.In the following years, Marceline roamed the land of Ooo and began killing vampires, who had taken over much of the land. Marceline soon discovered that, upon killing a vampire, she was able to acquire their unique abilities thanks to her demonic power to absorb souls.However, when she tried to fight the Vampire King himself, she was bitten and turned into a vampire herself. At some point, she began a romantic relationship with a magician named Ash. The two would move into the Tree Fort, but their relationship would come to an end. Presumably, around this time, Marceline befriended Princess Bubblegum, the leader of the Candy Kingdom; the two would often avoid official royal meetings and explore the Candy Kingdom's elaborate rock candy mining complex. Eventually, due largely to the mounting stress of running her kingdom, Bubblegum pushed Marceline away, leading to a rift between the two that lasted for a while.</p>
              <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the series' present, Marceline eventually comes into contact with Finn and Jake in the first season episode "Evicted!", when she forces them from their home. In the episode "Henchman", Marceline tricks Finn into becoming her accomplice. In the episode, Finn discovers that Marceline is fond of mischief and pranks. Soon thereafter, the two develop a friendship. In the second season premiere "It Came From the Nightosphere", Abadeer is accidentally summoned to Ooo by Finn. While Abadeer ravages the land, Finn discovers that there is animosity between Marceline and her father. Finn manages to distract Abadeer by playing a recording of Marceline's "Fry Song", which leads to a brief moment of reconciliation between the two before Finn sends him back to the Nightosphere. In the third season episode "Memory of a Memory", Ash attempts to rekindle his former relationship with Marceline via trickery. Disguised as Marceline's "spirit animal", he tricks Finn and Jake into believing that Marceline has fallen asleep due to a sleep spell that has been self-inflicted. Following Ash's advice, the two enter into Marceline's mind to retrieve the "memory core" in an attempt to wake her up. Along the way, they encounter various memories of her as a child following the Mushroom War. However, the duo soon learn that it was an elaborate trick by Ash; Finn and Jake actually removed Marceline's memory of their break-up. In the end, Finn is able to convince Marceline, and she promptly attacks her chauvinistic ex-boyfriend. In "What Was Missing", past animosity between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum is explored when Finn, Jake, Princess Bubblegum, BMO, and Marceline form a band in order to defeat the Door Lord and recover what was stolen from them</p>

              <h3 class="mt-0">Princess Bubblegum</h3>
              <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Princess Bubblegum is a "Gum Golem", a being composed of both human and candy DNA, and rules the Candy Kingdom, which is inhabited by other "Candy People". She is very good friends with the series' protagonists Finn the Human and Jake the Dog, first appearing with them in Ward's 2008 pilot.</p>
              <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bubblegum is typically very kind and compassionate, having a strong sense of justice, though she shows a dark side when provoked. She is highly intelligent, being responsible for the creation of the Candy People as well as various devices including a miniature time machine. She is fluent in German and Korean, using the latter language to communicate with her friend Lady Rainicorn. Bubblegum is skeptical of magic, refusing to acknowledge it as anything except science.
              Bubblegum is highly protective of the Candy People and cares deeply for their safety, but is secretly strained by the pressures of ruling and expresses a desire for freedom. Following a near-death experience at the end of the second season, she starts to isolate herself and becomes overprotective of the Candy People, even exhibiting authoritarian tendencies temporarily in the fifth season. At the end of the sixth season, Bubblegum is deposed as ruler following an election, where she realizes she has made the Candy People too unintelligent. Following the miniseries Stakes, Bubblegum is reinstated as ruler and becomes less overprotective.</p>

                <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lumpy Space Princess, often abbreviated as LSP, is the princess of Lumpy Space, an alternate dimension. As a "Lumper", made out of "irradiated stardust", she can convert other beings into Lumpers by biting them. LSP is spoiled and sarcastic, and is often shown living outdoors with salvaged furniture and appears to be homeless, because she has run away from her parents, who are the king and queen of Lumpy Space. She speaks with a thick Valley Girl Accent. LSP's relationship to Finn and Jake has always come off as nonchalant, but in the episode "Gotcha", LSP realizes that Finn is a person of good moral standing who teaches her that beauty comes from the inside, and in her premiere episode, she reveals to Finn that he's supposed to be her real friend, not like the "fake" ones she has in Lumpy Space.</p>
                <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lumpy Space Princess acts like a bratty, apathetic, sassy, attention-seeking and willfully ignorant teenager, often texting on her phone. She is the archetype of the teenage valley-girl "princess" affecting a self-centered, stubborn and rude persona. Her off-putting personality may actually be a way for her to cope with her own insecurities about her appearance. Furthermore, she seems to be more aware than she lets on. She acknowledged the shallow nature of her friendship with her fellow Lumpy Space folk compared to the more genuine friendship with Finn and Jake. In "The Lich" her star jewel did not fit into the Enchiridion; however, this may be because she is not the actual ruler of Lumpy Space since her parents are.</p>

                  <h3 class="mt-0">Earl of Lemongrab</h3>
                  <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his creation, he became the Earl of an Earldom (known as Lemongrab) and acquired Lemon Camel. Jesse Moynihan has stated that after he was born, Princess Bubblegum "stuck him in Castle Lemongrab," because, as Princess Bubblegum put it, "he doesn't get along with others," and he is frightening and sometimes violent to other candy people. He lived an extremely sheltered, and presumably wealthy life ever since. It is unconfirmed, but believed, that he was raised by servants and became spoiled and ignorant due to having everything he wanted handed to him without a connection to its source. This could be due to not being taught any better from an early age, as he oddly stated: "I don't know where food comes from." It was shown that he had been put in the castle at an extremely early age.[4] In the storyboards, it was shown that the Candy People said things like "Who's that again?" when he came to Princess Bubblegum's castle, indicating that he had been isolated from the rest of the people in the Candy Kingdom.</p>
                  <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being informed that Princess Bubblegum was under eighteen, the Earl travels to the Candy Castle and asserts himself as the temporary ruler of the Candy Kingdom. The Princess reluctantly relinquishes her position because, as she admits, he is currently older than her. As the ruler, he behaves in a manner that makes sense to him; screaming at the candy people and sending them to the dungeon without trial. This was also shown to be behavior executed by Princess Bubblegum when she did not get her way, and the people called her a tyrant. It could be that he was taught to behave in this manner, simply taking it to an extreme. Finn and the young Princess Bubblegum try to force the Earl to leave by playing pranks on him, but their attempts are in vain and cruel. Their final prank results in the Earl sentencing Finn, Princess Bubblegum and Peppermint Butler to one million years in the dungeon. When Princess Bubblegum returns to correct ruling age, the Earl of Lemongrab is unceremoniously fired and he leaves, upset and muttering to himself.</p>

                    <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich is the overall main antagonist of Adventure Time. He is an ancient, cosmic being who is the manifestation of the inevitable death of all things, whose essence was deposited on Earth millions of years before the start of the show via a catalyst comet, but who came into physical being near the end of the Mushroom War via a "mutagenic bomb" after he possessed a person who had been submerged in mutagenic waste. His first episodic appearance is in "His Hero" where the hero Billy casts him down. He was imprisoned in the ancient tree in the Candy Kingdom, but escapes and plays a significant role in "Mortal Folly," "Mortal Recoil," "Finn the Human," and "Jake the Dog." The Lich goes on to kill Prismo and releases the criminals in the Crystal Citadel in "Wake Up" and "Escape from the Citadel." However, by the end of the latter episode, the Lich is turned into a harmless baby by the Citadel Guardian's healing blood, and is adopted by Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig and renamed "Sweet Pig-Trunks," or "Sweet P" for short.</p>
                    <p class="character-bios">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In "The Comet," it is revealed by the Purple Comet that the Lich, like Finn, started out as an incarnation of the Catalyst Comets. The Purple Comet explains that it has embodied both the ultimate good by once becoming what would later be Finn, and the ultimate evil by at some point becoming the Lich in their respective time periods. In "Gold Stars," it is revealed that the Lich's power and evil is still contained within Sweet P, and can take over when Sweet P is threatened and emotionally charged. Sweet P. does not realize the evil lurking inside him, attributing his blackouts and dreams of being the Lich to being 'just a dream.'</p>
